📌 Overview
Brute force attacks are one of the most common techniques used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems. These attacks involve repeatedly attempting to guess valid usernames and passwords.
Detecting and responding to brute force attempts early can prevent credential compromise and lateral movement within a network.
Wazuh provides a robust set of built-in rules that automatically detect brute force patterns across authentication logs on Windows and Linux systems.

🛠️ Data Sources
Windows:
 ** Event ID 4625 – Failed logon attempt.
 ** Event ID 4624 – Successful logon.
 ** Event ID 4672 – Special privileges assigned to a new logon.

🔧 Attack Simulation
To simulate a brute force attack and test Wazuh’s detection capabilities, I used Hydra, a fast and flexible login cracker.

🔍 Command Used:
hydra -l user_name -P password.txt rdp://192.168.X.X
 ** -l user_name: specifies the target username
 ** -P password.txt: supplies a list of potential passwords
 ** rdp://192.168.X.X: defines the target RDP service and IP address

This generated multiple authentication attempts against a Windows system over Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

⚙️ Detection Using Wazuh Built-In Rules
Wazuh’s default ruleset successfully detected the brute force activity through the following rule IDs:

** 60122 – Logs each failed login (Event ID 4625)
  “Logon Failure – Unknown user or bad password”
 ** 60204 – Aggregates multiple 4625 events into a brute force detection
   “Multiple Windows Logon Failures”
 ** 67028 – Triggers if special privileges are assigned post-compromise
   “Special privileges assigned to new logon”
 ** 92657 – Detects potentially successful unauthorized RDP login
   “Successful Remote Logon Detected – Possible pass-the-hash attack”

The correlation of failed attempts followed by a successful logon highlights potential brute force success and post-exploitation activity.

✅ Summary
By using the Hydra tool to simulate a brute force attack on an RDP service, and leveraging Wazuh’s built-in rule set, I successfully detected:

 ** Repeated authentication failures
 ** Escalated alerts for brute force behavior
 ** Post-compromise activity including privilege escalation
 ** This validates Wazuh's capability to automatically detect and alert on brute force attacks in real-world scenarios without the need for custom rule development
