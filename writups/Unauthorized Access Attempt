üìå Objective
To detect after-hours logins by privileged users (e.g., Administrator account), specifically aligned with MITRE ATT&CK technique T1078.004 ‚Äì Valid Accounts: Privileged Accounts. This can help identify unauthorized access activities that typically occur outside normal working hours.

üß™ Test Scenario
Date: May 20, 2025
Time of Login: 5:46 PM (after-hours)
User Account: Administrator
Host: Windows endpoint monitored by Wazuh agent
Method: Remote desktop logon

üõ†Ô∏è Wazuh Rule Configuration
I added the following custom rule to /var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml:
<group name="local,custom_rules">
  <rule id="17101" level="9">
    <if_sid>92657</if_sid>
    <time>5 pm  - 8:30 am</time>
    <description>After-hours successful remote login detected for Administrator account (T1078.004).</description>
    <group>login_time,t1078.004,credential_access,rdp,windows,custom_alert</group>
  </rule>
</group>

üîç Rule Explanation
1- <if_sid>92657</if_sid>: Matches Wazuh‚Äôs built-in rule for successful remote logins (via RDP).
2- <time>5 pm - 8:30 am</time>: Restricts detection to off-hours (non-business hours).
3- <group> tag: Tags the alert with:
    ** t1078.004: MITRE ATT&CK technique
    ** credential_access, rdp: Tactic/technique context
    ** windows, custom_alert: Categorization for filtering in Wazuh dashboard

‚úÖ Validation Results
1- Logged in as Administrator at 5:46 PM using RDP.
2- Wazuh Agent captured the Windows Event ID 4624 (successful logon).
3- Rule 92657 (predefined in Wazuh) was triggered.
4-Custom Rule 17101 matched:
  ** Time of the event was within the specified after-hours range.
  ** Result: Alert was successfully triggered by the Wazuh manager.

‚úÖ Summary
 Wazuh custom rule successfully detected a remote login by Administrator outside business work , which falls within your defined after-hours range. 
The rule is mapped to MITRE T1078.004 and serves as a strong control for monitoring privileged account misuse outside business hours.
